# bgstudentforum

This has become a open source project (refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more)!

Code is being updated as development continues. <a href="https://www.bgstudentforum.com">BGSTUDENTFORUM</a> is a place designed for the pupils at BGS! This forum makes it so much easier to start initiatives and to make connections you otherwise would have been discouraged to make! It is an incubator for impactful ideas that can be implented in almost any school/instituition!
