<b>Want to contribute to an open source forum project?</b>

You have come to the right place as there are many things to be done to make this forum even more useful (be sure to fork, clone and commit your changes as well as creating a super user):
 <li>Enhance commenting feature by implementing threads (like on Reddit)</li>
 <li>Configure the UI to be more aesthetic</li>
 <li>Add feature to allow posts to have a picture or without one</li>
 <li>And of course add anything you want (provided it is functional)!</li>
